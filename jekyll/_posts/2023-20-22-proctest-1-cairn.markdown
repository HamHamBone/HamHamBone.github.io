# The Province Map

The setting generation rules first have us answer some questions about the general "theme" of the setting, things that are broadly true.

After some thinking I decide on some broad inspirations: Greek Mythology and the Studio Ghibli film Howl's Moving Castle.

- *How does magic work?* Magic is wielded by singular powerful individuals known as Magicians. Magicians inevitably have bargained for their power from powerful beings - dragons, sprites, godlings, and the like. 

- *What level of technology do the denizens have?* A mix of late middle era technology and diesel-punkish biotechnology.

- *How does religion function? Do gods walk the lands, and do the people know it?* The gods live far away on Mt. Rhuthun, partying the days and nights away after becoming bored of their creation.

- *Who are the PCs in the setting? What is their position with respect to those in power?* The PCs are agents of those in power - heroic figures, or walking in the tradition of *the* heroic figures of the past - think Odysseus or Jason and the Argonauts.

- *What species & backgrounds exist, and are they playable by PCs?* Human, Automaton, Half-Beast

- *What linguistic and cultural flavor exists in the setting?* Just because I have the lists handy, I'm going to use Catalan and Berber words for two rival kingdoms on the brink of war (think pre WWI standoff). I'm using Welsh for truely old things and Gods.

# The Province Map

A Cairn setting is broken up into Provinces, each part of a Domain of one or more provinces. Since I want two warring kingdoms, I'll create two small provinces, each part of two larger domains.

for each province, the procedure has us place a *heart*, the central settlement of the province, then create dots representing the *details* that represent the locations in the province, connected by roads, trails, or rivers

The procedure doesn't give any guidance on how to decide what type (road river, trail, tunnel) a connector is at this point, so I'll leave that for later.

After following the procedure, I got this result: two linked provinces.

We're also asked to generate seasonal weather: springs are mild and cloudy, summers are sweltering and humid, falls are mild an windy, and winters are frigid and stormy.

# Details

Next we generate the details dotting the provinces. There is a table for the detail's terrain (plains, forests, mountains, etc) and type (settlement, lair, landmark, etc) as well as subtables with more specificity for those types. The Heart is always a settlement, and the frontier is always the special type.

I'll keep in mind that the heart is "a settlement (of any size) that reflects the history, Factions, and peoples of the land." So I'll use what i generate from that to color the other results.

The generator also asks invent or generate names for the details at this point, so I'll do that as well.

There isn't much guidance for how much to write for each detail, so I will write one or two sentences for each at this point.
