A follow-up from my <a href="bottom-up-generation-1">previous post</a> on what I’m calling “bottom-up generation”.</p>

<p>It divides a singlular realm into a number of swathes of terrain (called zones) and furth subdivides those zones into regions (15 to 18 in total) each ready for us to generate a location within that will be the base components of our setting.</p>

<p><strong>Step 1</strong> - Draw a blobby, irregular shape on a piece of paper / some drawing program. This is your realm.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/bottom-up-generation-2/realm1.png" alt="realm 1 image" /></p>

<p><strong>Step 2</strong> - Divide the outside of the realm into 6 roughly equal sized and irregularly bordered border sections. Randomly select a border section with 1d6. Roll another d6, working clockwise, mark that many segments as sea. For each remaining land section, roll d6 - 1-3: neighboring realm, 4-6: wasteland.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3</strong> - Divide the realm into 3 roughly equal sized and irregularly bordered Terrain Zones, and divide each of those zones into 4 Wilderness Regions each.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/bottom-up-generation-2/realm4.png" alt="realm 1 image" /></p>

<p><strong>Step 4</strong> - Roll d6 for each Zone, on a 1-3 add one City Region, 4-6 add two. Add City Regions by carving out small areas) about half the size of the already existing regions from the zone.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/bottom-up-generation-2/realm5.png" alt="realm 1 image" /></p>

<p><strong>Step 5</strong> – In each Zone, roll a d4 to choose a region randomly. This region splits off into its own mini zone with a single region in it. At this point you should have three Zones with 3 regions each and three zones with one region each, along with some city regions.</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/bottom-up-generation-2/realm6.png" alt="realm 1 image" /></p>

<p><strong>Step 6</strong> - Generate terrain for each Zone. Use a random table or come up with your own. Keep it simple… A terrain type and an unusual detail is probably all you need at this point. Terrain in each of the city regions is farmland.</p>

<p>Roll twice on the following table and combine (wet+grassland=bog, forest+dry=thorn forest, etc).</p>

<p>Doubles indicate an exagerated type of that terrain (sweeping grasslands, towering mountains, etc.).</p>

<p>Weird means make it weird! (weird+forest=ghost trees, weird+wet=permanently foggy lands, etc.).</p>

<ol>
  <li>Grassland</li>
  <li>Forest</li>
  <li>Mountains</li>
  <li>Wet</li>
  <li>Dry</li>
  <li>Weird</li>
</ol>

<p>Generate two zone’s worth of terrain per bordering realm as well.</p>

<p>(this technique is snagged from <a href="https://crateredland.blogspot.com/2019/06/distant-lands-and-creation-thereof.html">this</a> post from <em>A Blasted Cratered Land</em>’s blog.)</p>

<p>Here is what the map from above looks like with some terrain drawn on it</p>

<p><img src="/blog/assets/bottom-up-generation-2/realm7.png" alt="realm 1 image" /></p>

<p><strong>Step 7</strong> - For each region, roll on the following table, this will give you a Major and Minor location within that region. Major locations we’ll give more detail to, and minor locations less detail. A Major Ruin might be a full-fledged dungeon, while a minor ruin might be a simple abandoned farmstead.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Settlement with a minor Ruin</li>
  <li>Settlement with a minor Landmark</li>
  <li>Ruin with a minor Settlement</li>
  <li>Ruin with a minor Landmark</li>
  <li>Landmark with a minor Settlement</li>
  <li>Landmark with a minor Ruin</li>
</ol>

<p>For city regions, roll d6 to determine only a minor location - the major location we know is the city.</p>

<p>1-2 Minor Settlement, 3-4 Minor Landmark, 5-6 Minor Ruin</p>

<p>Followup blog posts will go into generating and developing these locations, though there are many options for generating Landmarks, Settlements, and Ruins - Worlds Without Number, in particular, has some good tables for that purpose.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="rpg" /><category term="tools" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[This is a procedure for generating the geography of a fantasy region.

If you are not familiar with SWN. In that game, in order to build an interstellar sector to set the campaign in, the GM is asked to first randomly locate worlds on the sector map, then to roll on some tables to generate those worlds. So at hex 0305, there might be a burning industrial hell world inhabited by surly robots, while at neighboring hex 0306, you might find an airless casino-world secretly ruled by a eugenics cult (and etc).</p>

<p>Notably, the overall shape and setting of the sector is determined by the ways that the small generated bits of game content (the worlds, in this games case.) relate to each other. Perhaps I imagine that the foolish prince of the New Earth Hegemony has recently, against all odds, won the entire industrial robot planet in a huge bet against the cult-casino, and now all sorts of trouble is resulting. The random tables create a reasonably sized field of random goodies to forge connections and narrative out of.</p>

<p><a href="https://mausritter.com/">Mausritter’s</a> setting generation procedures are similar, generating a three layer hexflower’s worth of interesting tidbits to weave together.</p>

<p>Contrast this to the world-building procedures of the game <a href="https://preview.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/348809/worlds-without-number-free-edition">Worlds Without Number</a>. WWN asks the GM to work from the top down, starting from defining the basic facts of the fantasy world, to defining the various nations and geography of a region in that world, to finally defining the individual setting components that the players will interact with within the scope of a single nation or zone within that nation.</p>

<p>Whenever I try to use the setting generation tools in WWN, I tend to bounce off. There isn’t much support for the “top” of the top-down approach, no tables to roll on to help define the world-level setting details. Without a strong central concept, the settings that I’ve attempted to make using WWN have felt mushy and uninspiring (not that this is everyone’s experience, I just don’t mesh will with the tools provided).</p>

<p>The process for setting generation in WWN and SWN are notably different. In WWN, it is assumed that the GM will be several “setting layers” deep before generating the actual “content” of places, people, things in the campaign, while in SWN that is happening immediately.</p>

<p>So, what might a bottom-up approach similar to SWN’s for generating a fantasy world look like?</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>As soon as we can in the process, we should generate the low-level setting components.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>These components shouldn’t number more than about 20, preferably closer to a dozen. (SWN has the GM generate 20 to 30 worlds per sector, which in my experience is a little too many – to much detail can sometimes leave things feeling muddled, each component being washed out by the tide of detail.)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The procedure for generating for the components should be evocative, balanced between under and over definition.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>The setting-builder should be encouraged and given the tools to build the setting by addition and weaving together the results from the various different setting components.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>In the following blog posts, I will be showing off a procedure that I have devised to generate a fantasy setting, starting with a procedure for generating the overall geography and location of the components of the setting.</p>]]></content><author><name></name></author><category term="rpg" /><category term="tools" /><summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m a big fan of how the game Stars Without Number does procedural setting generation from the bottom-up.
