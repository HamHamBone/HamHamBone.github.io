			Make your way to the central sandbox hub, warding for phantom beaks. Tools like divination cards will help avoid false leads that go nowhere. You'll be on the right path when you see the [GLYPHSOME SANDS] outside the oasis through an exterior grille, where your ex used nodes in ways you'd never imagined. With the right aerial view, you should just now be realizing that the perpetual sandstreams she glitched into existance are surely an artistic response to the dustlike crystal Spray that killed her home, and the six-legged sandshapes rising-prancing dissolving in them aren't bullshit fantasy monsters but destriers, the animals she loved and feared and are forever gone. Try considering the depths of her interiority completely apart from your pasty self that you never knew and never will. This will hurt you because you are evil.
